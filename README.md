RenderCoreAnimationToVideo
==========================

This is sample code that shows how to render a CALayer instance to a QuickTime video file. 

Sadly, there appears to be a bug in Mountain Lion (10.8) that causes improper teardown of the threads that AVFoundation uses. As this seems to happen in the Apple frameworks, these little we can do about apart from reporting the issue.
